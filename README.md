# Uses

If you find something useful here, free free to share and ‚≠êÔ∏è the repo. Also, if you feel I am missing interesting things, put it on the [issues](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/uses/issues) and I'll definitely try it out.

---

## üíª Hardware

I currently use an M1 MacBook Air. 8-Core 8GB RAM version. It's crazy fast and power efficient. With my frontend development workflow it gives me about 1.5 days to 2 days.

## üåö Dark or üåû Light?

I have joined the light side. I gave the dark side a bunch of tries but it hurts my eyes. All the themes and color schemes I have mentioned are light.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Font

I have gotten into the habit of using the same font across all my tools. My current favourite is [Julia Mono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/download/).

- Legible
- Supports Ligatures

## üë®‚Äçüíª Code Editor

### Primary

I have switched over to [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Even though it's on the heavier side and slightly slower than VS Code, I find the intellisense in WebStorm to be far superior. I do use VS Code sometimes when I need to open one off files or quickly iterate on a demo or write blog posts.

#### Configuration

- **Theme** : IntelliJ Light
- **Color Scheme** : GitHub

### Secondary

VS Code is my secondary code editor for light work and one off things.

#### Configuration

- **Color Theme** : [GitHub Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thenikso.github-plus-theme) & [Tailwind Breeze](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=praveenpuglia.tailwind-breeze). I keep switching between these two.
- **File Icon Theme** : [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons).

Let me know if you want to know the plugins I use and I'll put it on a gist and embed it here.

## üì∫ Terminal Emulator & Shell

### Emulator

There isn't a better terminal than [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). It's simply the best.

#### Configuration

- **Theme** : [Night Owlish Light](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/night-owlish-theme).
- **Other Settings**
  - Profile > General > Working Directory > Reuse Previous Session's Directory.
  - Preferences > Appearance > Theme > Minimal

### Shell

Spend a lot of time here so this configuration is dear to me. My goal is to have maximum flexibility while not losing performance. Shell load times should not be more than 0.2s for me. Beyond that it starts to feel laggy.

#### Configuration

- **List Files** : [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa). With `alias ls=exa` in `.zshrc`.
- **Prompt** : I use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). Crazy fast and feature rich. Make sure to use transient prompts & instant prompts.
- **Shell** : [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) & this [.zshconfig](https://github.com/praveenpuglia/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc)
- **Shell Text Editor** : [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro). Yeah! Skipping the Vim vs Emacs war altogether.
- **Oh-My-Zsh Plugins** : `(git git-extras z zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions)`
- **SSH** : I use AutoSSH for SSH connections. Handles automatic reconnection of tunnels like a pro.
- **Git** : I use Git with [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) as the diffing tool for much better diff experience.
- **Other Tools**
  - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) : fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
  - [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm): Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust
  - [fkill-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/fkill-cli): To find and kill processes.

## üåé Browsers

I have all the popular browsers installed but I regularly use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?r=1) on both my Mac and my Android phone. It feels fast and smooth. I haven't had any memory issues with it like I sometimes used to get with Google Chrome.

## üîê Password Manager & Authenticator

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/): The free version is extremely good already.
I am a pro, unlimited [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) user but I settled to Bitwarden.

[Authy](https://authy.com/): Authy as the TOTP or 2FA Authenticator App. Primary reason is that it syncs across devices and has a desktop app too.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Mail

[Mimestream](https://mimestream.com/): A native macOS email client for Gmail

## ü™ü Window Management

[Magnet](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12): The best. Works with both keyboard and mouse/trackpad.

## üèÉ Productivity

- MacOS Notes
- [Notion](https://notion.so)
- [Office 365 Suite](https://www.office.com/)
- [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/): The free version is good enough for me.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): No intro needed.
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): The REST & GraphQL Client.
- [GasMask](https://github.com/2ndalpha/gasmask): Hosts file manager for MacOS.
- [ElasticVue](https://elasticvue.com/): The best GUI for ElasticSearch I have found so far.
